### SAMR Operation Numbers Details

The table below provides an overview of SAMR operation numbers (OpNums) relevant to enumeration. Each OpNum represents a specific operation that can be performed through the SAMR protocol. The table includes the following details for each OpNum:
- OpNum: The unique identifier for the operation.
- Name: The official name of the operation.
- Data Type in Response: The format of the data returned in response to the operation.
- Description: A brief explanation of the operationâ€™s functionality and purpose.
