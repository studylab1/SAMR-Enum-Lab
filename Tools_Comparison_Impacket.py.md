# Impacket Tool Evaluation

Impacket library is a suite of tools for interacting with network protocols.  SAMR requests were executed against a cross-forest domain controller `zdc1.domain-z.local` from the client `yws.domain-y.local`.

The network traffic captured was encrypted. To decrypt the capture in Wireshark, the NT password `LabAdm1!` must be provided under:  
`Preferences > Protocols > NTLMSSP > NT Password`
**"LINK"**

## samrdump.py

Executed with the following parameters:  
`python.exe samrdump.py domain-y/enum:LabAdm1!@zdc1.domain-z.local`

#### Request Specification Compliance in Detail

This evaluation analyzed compliance with the SAMR protocol's "Desired Access" field, focusing on access permissions requested during operations. The "Desired Access" field in the SAMR header specifies permissions requested for each operation.
The analysis followed the sequence of operations observed in the network traffic. Duplicate entries with identical permissions were omitted for clarity. Non-compliant entries are explicitly highlighted.
